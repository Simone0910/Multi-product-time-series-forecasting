# Multi-product-time-series-forecasting
With our project, “The Crystal Ball of Market Forecasting”, we use sales market data provided to us by Unieuro from January 2015 to February 2022 to predict sales for the following year (from March 2022 to February 2023). The provided data contains historical time series of the sales for each Product Group, Brand, and Sector. Therefore, our goal is to predict offline sales (sales in physical retail stores) and online sales (sales made through the website) individually for each product group of each brand during the mentioned period. This goal is achievable thanks to methods and models of time series forecasting
